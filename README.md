# Project Overview

Welcome to the Global Terrorism Analysis miniproject. The aim of this notebook is to explore the terrorist events around the world. This dataset contains 181,691 line items of the terrorism activities that happened between 1970 to 2017. With this extensive data,there is an opportunity for a data analyst to come out with interesting findings. Plots are used in this notebook, for making the exploration easy and more informative.

Download data set, Global Terrorism Database, from https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd. Then, save it in catalog named 'input'. 
This is necessary because the dataset is too big for github repo.
Libs which are necessary to run the code:
    
    ```
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
    
    ```
